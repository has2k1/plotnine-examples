A Song of Ice and Fire Speculative World Map
Released 2015-05-01

Intellectual property of A Song of Ice and Fire, this map and all locations copyright George RR Martin (www.georgerrmartin.com).

Map of Westeros (original version) created originally by Tear of the Cartographer's Guild (http://www.cartographersguild.com/showthread.php?t=6683), updated and extended by theMountainGoat (http://www.sermountaingoat.co.uk/map/index.php) in 2012: Updates to Westeros, addition of Essos, Sothoryos, Ibben and the Summer Isles based in part upon the speculative world map drawn by Werthead (www.thewertzone.blogspot.com). Some locations positioned according to the maps drawn by Other-in-Law.

These GIS-map-files are based on this work and are created by cadaei in QGIS 2.8.

The scale is of course not exact, as it is not clear what projection the original map used and on what kind of planet the map is located. I placed the continents roughly on the place of the coordinates of Africa to minimize the distortion near the poles. The scale is slightly too small (the Wall is only 240 miles long), so don't use the map for distance measuring. It's thought to provide the vector-geometry and labels of the world of a Song of Ice and Fire.

Locations have a field 'confirmed' which is '1' for confirmed locations and '0' for locations with speculative location.

The Areas outside the polygons of the file officialMapAreas.shp are the parts of the map which are not official and based on assumptions (see http://www.sermountaingoat.co.uk/map/index.php for more info about how theMountainGoat created these areas) and can be outdated.
